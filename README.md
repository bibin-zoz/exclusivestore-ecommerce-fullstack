## Introduction

This E-commerce project is a comprehensive solution that allows users to browse products, manage their shopping carts, and securely complete transactions. The implementation follows the MVC architecture, providing a well-organized structure for easy development and maintenance.  

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with Postgres using GORM, a powerful Object Relational Mapper for Go.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Efficient handling of JSON requests and responses using AJAX.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Follows the MVC design pattern for easy scalability and maintainability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive user interface for seamless navigation and a smooth shopping experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Go lang**: The main programming language for the project.
- **Gin**: A web framework for Go, providing a minimalistic yet powerful foundation.
- **Postgres**: The chosen relational database for data storage.
- **VSCode**: The integrated development environment used for coding.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication.
- **GORM**: An Object Relational Mapper for Go lang, simplifying database interactions.
- **AJAX**: Used for asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend for JSON requests and responses.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-project.git


   Certainly! Below are detailed sections for the specified blocks:

### Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Access the application through the provided URL or local server.

2. Navigate through the user interface to explore different sections such as product listings, user profiles, and shopping carts.

3. Perform user authentication using the implemented JWT-based authentication system.

4. Experience seamless data interactions with the database through the integration of GORM and Postgres.

5. Utilize AJAX for handling JSON requests and responses, ensuring efficient and dynamic communication between the frontend and backend.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`/controllers`**: Contains the controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and managing the application flow.

- **`/models`**: Defines the data models used in the project, which are then translated to database tables using GORM.

- **`/views`**: Manages the HTML templates for rendering the user interface.

- **`/static`**: Includes static files such as stylesheets, scripts, and images.

- **`main.go`**: The entry point of the application.

Feel free to explore and modify the structure based on your specific needs.

### Database Setup

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. **Database Installation**: Install and set up Postgres on your system.

2. **Database Configuration**: Update the database connection details in the project's configuration file (`config.go` or similar).

3. **Run Migrations**: Execute database migrations to create the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   go run migration.go
   ```

### Authentication

The project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. Follow these steps:

1. **User Registration**: Implement a user registration endpoint that securely stores user credentials in the database.

2. **User Login**: Create an authentication endpoint that validates user credentials and generates a JWT upon successful login.

3. **Token Validation**: Protect your routes by validating JWTs for each incoming request. If a valid token is not present, deny access.

### AJAX Integration

AJAX is seamlessly integrated into the project for handling asynchronous requests and responses. Key points include:

1. **AJAX Library**: Ensure that the necessary AJAX library or functionality is included in the frontend codebase.

2. **JSON Communication**: All communication between the frontend and backend is done through JSON requests and responses.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms for AJAX requests to provide a smooth user experience.
